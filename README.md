# Twitter Bot üñ•Ô∏è

Hey! This Python script is able to send a tweet in an automated fashion. It uses the Selenium WebDriver module and ChromeDriver to control Chrome and send the tweet. 
<br />
Please Note: This script is meant for Chrome. For compatibility with other search engines use the driver designed for that program.
